PID tuning:

I performed manual tuning of the PID controller.

Proportional Gain: 

Output of the proportional control is proportional to the cross track error.
Higher the error, harder the car is turned towards the desired trajectory.
If the gain is high then the oscillations are massive. On the other hand if the gain is low
the response time of the system could be poor.
Frankly, the simulation works with 0 proportional gain.
This definitely won't be a realistic solution in real world.

Derivative Gain:

Output of the derivative control acts opposite to that of proportional control.
It has a resistance effect and tends to reduce the oscillations.
Higher the gain, slower the response time of the system.

Integral Gain:

If there is a system bias, the only way to reduce it is by introducing the integral
controller. It reduces the offset. Higher the gain, more unstable the system becomes.
